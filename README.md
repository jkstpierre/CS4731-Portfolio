# CS4731 Projects Documentation

## Overview 

Each project has its own specific project folder wherein all the code
specific to that project exists as well as where the .html file for loading the 
program into a browser is located. Each project is dependent on the files
located in lib so be sure not to change the relative path between the lib folder
and each of the project folders. Inside the lib folder are the three files provided by
the instructor for this course in addition to a custom "toolkit" of my own 
to further abstract the OpenGL code.

## Project 1

Inside the "Project 1" folder exists the Project1.html and Project1.js files.
To run the program, simply click on Project1.html and it will automatically
be loaded into your browser of choice. Additionally there is a data folder
which contains the .dat files to be loaded in for viewing.
